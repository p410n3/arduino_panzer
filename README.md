# Arduino_panzer
A school project for a Arduino-driven, controllable Tank. With Bluetooth, Ultrasonic-Sensors and a Linetracker.

Made by XylofonKobra414, Kiste, Razlu and Me.

For the Bluetooth Controls we use [THIS APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nextprototypes.BTSerialController&hl=de)

We uploaded the Layout as a Backup-File so its possible to just import it.
